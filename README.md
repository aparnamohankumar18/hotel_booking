# Hotel Booking Demand Forecast
Forecast Hotel Booking Demand with Economic Indicators

## Objective
This project aims to perform Predictive Analysis on the Hotel Booking Dataset with Economic Indicators to forecast demand.

## About Dataset
This dataset contains 119390 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017. I have coupled each month of booking with leading economic indicators for the United States for that timeframe using the FRED.
While this dataset does not specify the location of the hotels, I have gone with the assumption of both being located in the United States for ease of applying economic data for learning purposes.

## Acknowledgments
The data is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019. The original cleaned version was uploaded to Kaggle by by Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat. I used that dataset to couple with various indicators:
GDP, CPI, CPI for Hotels, Fuel Prices, Disposable income per capita, Inflation, Consumer Sentiment, GINI Indicator, Inspiration

The purpose of this project is to build a classification model to forecast booking demand for each hotel.
